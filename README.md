# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Course_Project_1
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 

Loading the data: 
After loading the data-
The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. Only the data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 is used by subsetting.
Date variable is converted to Date classes in R using the as.Date() function. 

Making Plots: 
Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, and so on.  
A separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2, etc.) is created that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the 
plot1.png. 
 Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
